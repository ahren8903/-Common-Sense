Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side

No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I wish love was always this easy
But every now and then it brings us down
But I know that I can count on you
To keep the music playing on
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side
Love comes close to you
Your love it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back
